### Morning: Testosterone is highest
#### What he is like
- energetic, talkative, aggressive, focused, competitive, independent, impulsive and confident.
#### Negative sides

- be more likely to say “no” to a favor or request
#### Best for him to
- assemble a DIY desk, compete in a contest, work on a project solo, figure out the best driving route, and enjoy passionate sex.

### Afternoon: Testosterone is in the middle of its cycle
#### What he is like
- He’s a tad mellower than his morning self, but isn’t going on empty just yet
- he’s still upbeat, driven and focused, but not as easily ticked off
- He’s more open to working with others rather than going solo.
#### Negative sides
- N/A
#### Best for him to
- work as part of a team, pitch clients or customers, brainstorm ideas, go on a date.

### Evening: Testosterone is lowest
#### What he is like
- He’s a tad mellower than his morning self, but isn’t going on empty just yet
- he’s still upbeat, driven and focused, but not as easily ticked off
- He’s more open to working with others rather than going solo.
#### Negative sides
- N/A
#### Best for him to
- do activities that rejuvenate his energy if he wants a pick-me-up (such as playing an instrument or exercising), enjoy relaxing activities in keeping with his current low energy level (such as reading or watching a documentary), cuddle with his partner.

### The Exceptions
#### Research shows that a man’s testosterone spikes when 
- he drinks alcohol or caffeine
- watches an action movie
- looks at a person he finds sexually attractive (either in real life or simply an image)
- plays video games or competes in or anticipates a sports game or chess game.
- His testosterone also rises when he simply watches his favorite team compete.
#### When a man experiences a spike in his testosterone, this can make him more 
- impulsive and increase his desire to take risks.
- Research shows that a sudden rise in testosterone makes men likely to spend more money and take other financial risks.
#### A sharp rise in testosterone can also make men more aggressive
- which may be one reason why some men who watch their favorite sports team win a major tournament then go on to celebrate by rioting in the streets and turning over cars. Sure, beer likely helps fuel that behavior, but high testosterone plays a role, too.
#### Testosterone can plunge suddenly, too. 
- For example, research shows that when a man watches his favorite sports team lose a game, his testosterone dips sharply.
- This decline in testosterone can then make him blue, cranky or lethargic.
#### How do testosterone levels change throughout the day?
- The levels of testosterone in your blood change throughout the day. Your testosterone is at its highest around the time you wake up and lowest about 12 hours later. This pattern across the day is called a ‘diurnal rhythm’ and happens normally in many of your body’s hormonal systems.
- Diurnal Rhythm - A pattern that follows a daily cycle but is not synchronized by light.
